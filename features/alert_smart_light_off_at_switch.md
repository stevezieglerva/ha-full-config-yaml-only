# Alert when smart lights are turned off at the switch

The following lights have smart bulbs that can be turned off at the switch. This automation will alert when any of these lights are turned off at the switch.

You can tell these smart lights have been turned off the switch because they havenâ€™t been seen in 30 minutes. I want to notify to my phone when one of these has been turned off and also like to have Alexa virtual switches for each one of these lights that I can trigger and then create Alexa routines to announce specific switches are off.
