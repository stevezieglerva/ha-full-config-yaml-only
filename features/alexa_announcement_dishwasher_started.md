# purpose
Allow me to tell Alexa that the dishwasher started so that it can kick off the dishwasher timer, even without a button push

# Task
- Add an input boolean to for alexa said dishwaster started
- Update the dishwaster start process to look at this boolean turning on in addition to the aqara button being pushed.
- Add another input boolean to trigger an alexa announcement that dishwasher has been started.
